
### Working (sort of?)
- Timer
- Music (play artist, playlist and song using mopidy)
- Lights (on and off only)
- TV (playing a show from Netflix or Amazon on a roku)
- Thermostat (up, down, temperature)

### Buggy-ish
- Multi room support is not complete for anything. Initial responses all work but media player 
  selection and later response are a toss up.

### Not implemented
- Weather
- Lots of music functions
- Ask Wolfram
- Ask Google
- Lots of TV Functions

### TODO
- Multi room support for media and tv player
- Weather Assistant working (waiting on dark sky python libs to support lang, poking dev now)

### 0.0.1 Initial Commit
- just getting started
